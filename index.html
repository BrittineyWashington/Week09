<h4>About Me</h4>
After receiving my masters in counseling psychology (2014), I provided mental/behavioral health services to various populations, ranging from early childhood to adult. These services covered individual, family, group, prevention & crisis treatments in a variety of settings, utilizing a collection of modalities to best serve those populations. Recently, I have taken a sabbatical so that I may pursue an opportunity to increase my problem-solving skills in a different way, that is through becoming a frontend software developer. <br><br>

For as long as I can remember, I have loved solving all sorts of puzzles, from word searches to complex logic games. Because of this love for problem-solving, I have been able to accomplish many achievements that have helped me to become the successful person I am today. I am constantly challenging myself to learn new skills and ways to be of help to others. <br><br>

In my spare time I enjoy photography, watching AEW, sewing, playing all sorts of games (card, board, video), painting, and the occasional camping/hiking trip.
